# Weather App

Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/weather-app).

## Functionality

This is the [Weather App](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app) project, where I practice creating asynchronous Javascript functions by creating a simple app to let the user search by city and temperature unit, and see a short summary of that city's current weather. This uses [OpenWeatherMap's API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for the weather, and also [GIPHY's API](https://developers.giphy.com/) to pull in a random GIF related (hopefully!) to that weather.

## Thoughts

After spending so much time reading and wracking my brains over asynchronous functions, it finally makes sense and it was great getting to put that to use in this very simple project. Though it was simple, it was just enough to get me using some of these new concepts. I was incredibly grateful for `async` and `await`, as they made this much easier than using callbacks and promises. Still also grateful that The Odin Project started me off with callbacks and promises though, as understanding all that makes for a good foundation. But I do appreciate having an easier way to do these things.

I could've put more effort into stylizing this page, and in the future I might return and do that. I just didn't want to this time around, so that I could really just focus in on the new concepts I've been learning.

God bless.
